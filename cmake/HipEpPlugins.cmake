# Static compiler-plugin registration.
#
# A plugin that contributes MLIR (a pass, a dialect/op, an interface model) must
# land its registration in the host's process-global MLIR state -- one pass
# registry, one set of op TypeIDs. The only robust way to guarantee that is to
# make the plugin and host ONE binary: plugins are linked STATICALLY into the
# host at configure time, not loaded at runtime. This needs no symbol export and
# no dynamic loader, so it behaves identically on every platform. See
# docs/design/plugin-interface.md, "Linkage model".
#
# Mechanism:
#   * `HIPDNN_EP_COMPILER_PLUGINS` (cache) is the semicolon-separated list of
#     plugin ids to link into this build. Default empty => no plugins (the
#     production default; the dispatch is a no-op and nothing is linked).
#   * A plugin package calls `hipdnn_ep_compiler_plugin_register(PLUGIN_ID <id>
#     TARGET <static-lib-target>)` to make itself AVAILABLE. Being available is
#     not being selected -- only ids listed in `HIPDNN_EP_COMPILER_PLUGINS` are
#     actually linked.
#   * `hipdnn_ep_finalize_static_plugins()` (called once, after every plugin
#     package has registered) generates
#     `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/hip/Compiler/StaticLinkedPlugins.inc` -- one
#     `HANDLE_PLUGIN_ID(<id>)` line per selected plugin -- and links the
#     selected plugin static libs into `LibHipCompiler`.
#   * `lib/Compiler/StaticPlugins.cpp` (in LibHipCompiler) includes that .inc
#     twice: once to `extern "C"`-declare each `hipEpRegisterPlugin_<id>`, once
#     to CALL each. The explicit call is essential: it is the reference that
#     keeps the linker's dead-code elimination (`--gc-sections` / `/OPT:REF`)
#     from discarding the plugin object -- registration must never depend on a
#     static initializer, which such a collected object would silently drop.
#
# A plugin's per-id entry point is a single extern "C" function:
#
#     extern "C" void hipEpRegisterPlugin_<id>(hip::compiler::HipEpPluginRegistry &R);
# ============================================================================

# own: if the shared aggregate libLLVM.so ever becomes DT_NEEDED (it is dragged
# in transitively by an MLIR imported target's interface deps), the linker
# unifies definitions and promotes the binary's statically-absorbed
# llvm::/mlir:: symbols into .dynsym with default visibility. Those exported
# symbols then INTERPOSE the private libLLVM that ROCm's comgr dlopen()s at HIP
# init: comgr's global constructors bind to our (different-build, different-ABI)
# LLVM and crash the process before any kernel runs. A plugin that pulls in MLIR
# is the canonical trigger; a plugin-free build is only accidentally safe
# because --as-needed drops the shared libLLVM.
#
# The EP shared library is already protected by its --version-script (local: *);
# the tool executables have no such script, so hide every static-archive symbol
# from the dynamic table here. This matches the idiom LLVM uses on its own tools and does
# not affect JIT symbol resolution (LlvmIrJit resolves runtime symbols from the
# JIT'd runtime bitcode + absoluteSymbols + DT_NEEDED shared libs, never from the
# executable's own .dynsym). No-op off ELF -- Mach-O/PE have no cross-module
# symbol interposition and neither linker supports --exclude-libs.
